It works by randomly arranging the address space positions of key data areas of a process, such as the **base of the executable** and the positions of the **stack, heap and libraries**.\n\n## The Attack Vector\n### 1. Information Leaks\nThe most common way to bypass ASLR is to find an **information leak** vulnerability. If an attacker can read a pointer from the stack or heap, they can calculate the base address of the module.\n\n### 2. Heap Spraying\nInjecting a sequence of NOP slides and shellcode into the heap to increase the probability of execution.\n\n```c\n// A simple example of a potential pointer leak\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid vulnerable_function() {\n    char buffer[64];\n    // If we leak what's after 'buffer', we might find a saved EIP\n    printf(\"Buffer location: %p\\n\", (void*)buffer);\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nASLR is **not a silver bullet**. It must be combined with other mititgations like **DEP/NX** and **Stack Canaries** to provide robust protection."
