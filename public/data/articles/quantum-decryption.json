This article explores how Shor's algorithm could render RSA encryption obsolete...\n\n### Impact on RSA-2048\nIt is estimated that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could factor a 2048-bit RSA key in a matter of hours.\n\n### Post-Quantum Alternatives\nLattice-based cryptography is currently the leading candidate for replacing classical asymmetric encryption."
